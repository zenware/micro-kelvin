# Simple x86_64 Operating System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of a simple operating system (OS) designed for x86_64 architecture. The OS aims to provide basic functionalities like memory management, process scheduling, and simple input/output operations.

## Components

### Bootloader

- **Purpose**: Initializes the system and loads the kernel into memory.
- **Components**:
  - **Stage 1**: Minimal initial boot code to set up a basic execution environment.
  - **Stage 2**: Extended boot code that initializes hardware and loads the kernel.

### Kernel

- **Purpose**: Core component of the OS, managing system resources and operations.
- **Components**:
  - **Memory Management**: Manages physical and virtual memory spaces.
    - **Paging**: Implements virtual memory through paging.
    - **Heap Management**: Allocates and frees dynamic memory.
  - **Process Management**: Handles process creation, execution, and termination.
    - **Scheduler**: Decides which process runs at any given time, implementing context switching.
    - **Process Table**: Keeps track of all running processes.
  - **File System**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
    - **Virtual File System (VFS)**: Provides a uniform interface to different storage devices.
    - **Disk Management**: Interfaces with physical storage devices.
  - **Device Drivers**: Interfaces between the kernel and hardware devices.
    - **Input Devices**: Keyboard, mouse.
    - **Output Devices**: Display, printer.

### User Space

- **Purpose**: Executes user applications, isolated from kernel space.
- **Components**:
  - **System Libraries**: Provides system call interfaces to user applications.
  - **User Applications**: Independent programs executed by users.
  - **Shell**: Command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.

### Inter-process Communication (IPC)

- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Pipes**: Allows processes to communicate through a shared data stream.
  - **Signals**: Notification system between processes.
  - **Shared Memory**: Allows multiple processes to access a common memory segment.
  - **Sockets**: Enables communication between processes over a network.

### Security

- **Components**:
  - **User Authentication**: Verifies user identity through login credentials.
  - **Permissions**: Manages access rights for files and processes.
  - **Encryption**: Protects data integrity and privacy.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a foundation for a simple, yet functional, x86_64 operating system. Each component is designed to offer essential services, facilitating a stable and efficient computing environment.
